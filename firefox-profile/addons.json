What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn't track you. Ever.\n• Decode Privacy Policies — We’ve partnered with Terms of Service Didn't Read to include their scores and labels of website terms of service and privacy policies, where available.\n\nAs you search and browse, DuckDuckGo shows you a Privacy Grade rating when you visit a website (A-F). This rating lets you see how protected you are at a glance, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying site's privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.\n\nToo many people believe you simply can’t expect privacy on the Internet. We're fighting to change that, and have made it our mission to set a new standard of trust online. Install DuckDuckGo and take back your privacy!\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/\nDevice Privacy Tips: https://spreadprivacy.com/tag/device-privacy-tips/\nMore Privacy Education: https://spreadprivacy.com/tag/privacy-newsletter/\nOur Privacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/\n\nOpen source at https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension.\n\nYou can always reach us via email at firefox@duckduckgo.com.

Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.\n\nIt is not guaranteed that challenges are always solved, the limitations of the technology need to be considered.\n\nThe continued development of Buster is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please consider contributing with Patreon, PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\nUser input simulation\n\nUser input simulation can be enabled from the extension's options, and requires the installation of a client app, which enables Buster to send native user input to the browser and helps improve the success rate of the extension and lower the occurrence of temporary blocks.\n\nFollow the instructions to download and install the client app on Windows, Linux and macOS after enabling the feature, or get the app from the Buster Client repository.\n\nSolving more than a couple of reCAPTCHA challenges a day may lead to a temporary block regardless of using the extension.\n\nAnti-fingerprinting prevents the client app from working as expected, visit the about:config page to make sure privacy.resistFingerprinting is set to false.\n\nMotivation\n\nreCAPTCHA challenges remain a considerable burden on the web, delaying and often blocking our access to services and information depending on our physical and cognitive abilities, our social and cultural background, and the devices or networks we connect from.\n\nThe difficulty of captchas can be so out of balance, that sometimes they seem friendlier to bots than they are to humans.\n\nThe goal of this project is to improve our experience with captchas, by giving us easy access to solutions already utilized by automated systems.\n\nRequired permissions:\n\n    Access your data for all websites: required for accessing challenges\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox: needed for interacting with the client app when user input simulation is enabled\n    Display notifications: used for displaying error messages\n    Access browser activity during navigation: needed for resetting challenges\n\n\nThe extension is also available for Chrome and Edge.\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\nhttps://github.com/dessant/buster","weeklyDownloads":3631,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Armin Sebastian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/12929064/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/211/211910.png?modified=1580687752","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211910.png?modified=1580687752","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Solve the captcha by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/211/211911.png?modified=1580687752","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211911.png?modified=1580687752","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Solve the captcha by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget."}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/ArminSebastian/5?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.25,"reviewCount":66,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/buster-captcha-solver/reviews/","updateDate":1592133911000}]}
